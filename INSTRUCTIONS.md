# Check Point CoPilot — User Instructions

Welcome to the Check Point-focused OpenCode Codespace.

## What to do first

1. Open the forwarded **OpenCode Web UI** port: `4096`
2. Open the forwarded **HTML Reports** port: `8081`
3. If setup is marked **pending**, complete the guided setup in the terminal:
   - `bash scripts/first-run-checkpoint-setup.sh`

## Required secrets

Set these as GitHub Codespaces secrets for the repository or your account:

- `CHECKPOINT_MGMT_HOST`
- `CHECKPOINT_USERNAME`
- `CHECKPOINT_PASSWORD`
- `CHECKPOINT_DOC_CLIENT_ID`
- `CHECKPOINT_DOC_SECRET_KEY`
- `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` (optional but recommended)

## What this environment is optimized for

Use this Codespace primarily for:

- Check Point policy inspection
- object and rule review
- management log analysis
- threat prevention review
- HTTPS inspection analysis
- documentation-backed troubleshooting
- HTML report generation into `reports/`

## Important behavior expectations

- Prefer the configured Check Point MCP tools over raw API calls.
- Do **not** use direct `curl`, ad-hoc Python requests, or custom raw API calls to the Check Point management server unless you are explicitly troubleshooting MCP or the user explicitly requests raw API behavior.
- Clearly separate facts, inferences, and recommendations.
- Do not print or store secrets in outputs or reports.

## Useful local commands

- Guided setup: `bash scripts/first-run-checkpoint-setup.sh`
- Start OpenCode: `bash scripts/start-opencode-web.sh`
- Start reports server: `bash scripts/start-report-server.sh`
- Re-run welcome flow: `bash scripts/post-attach.sh`
- Validate environment: `bash scripts/validate-environment.sh`

## Success checklist

You are in a good state when:

- OpenCode is reachable on port `4096`
- the reports server is reachable on port `8081`
- setup status is `complete`
- OpenCode can see the configured MCP servers without slow package-install retries

## Suggested first prompts

- "Inspect access policy for broad allow rules and summarize top risk findings."
- "Investigate drops to 10.20.30.40 over the last 24h and identify likely root causes."
- "Summarize threat-prevention profiles and exceptions, then identify coverage gaps by severity."
- "Generate an HTML report in reports/ with findings, sources used, and next steps."
